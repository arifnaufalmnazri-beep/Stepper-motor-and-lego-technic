# Stepper-motor-and-lego-technic
I made a small build using lego technic parts and gears to see whether the stepper motor connected to an arduino will actually move them. I'm looking to use the results to build a working lego technic car that runs on the stepper motor. 

## Demo
Here's the test run actually working.

## Parts
-Lego technic beam, gears, axles and wheels
-Duct tape and sticky tack for mounting
-Stepper motor (28BYJ-48) + ULN2003 driver 
-Arduino UNO

## How it works
The stepper motor rests on a platform(and held with my hand, becaue it kept on vibrating). The stepper motor is taped to the axle that holds the gear. When it's acivated, it turns that axle which then turns other gears and makes the wheels move. I can control the rotation speed and direction in Arduino IDE.

## Code
Here's the Arduino sketch I used:  [carStepper.ino](carStepper.ino)

## Future plans
I'm planning on using this to build a lego car that runs on a stepper motor soon. This is my first post here, and I hope that this, and many others following it, will help me get a scholarship to Taylor's university here in Malaysia. It's a really awesome univeristy I want to attend. So, wish me luck!
