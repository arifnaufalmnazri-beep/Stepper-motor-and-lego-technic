# Stepper-motor-and-lego-technic
I made a small build using lego technic parts and gears to see whether the stepper motor connected to an arduino will actually move them. I'm looking to use the results to build a working lego technic car that runs on the stepper motor.  This is my first step towards that scholarship. Wish me luck!
